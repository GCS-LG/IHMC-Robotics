# MIT Mini-Cheetah

Outline of research for achieving extreme dynamic behaviours with MIT Mini-Cheetah at IHMC Robotics.

We are generating with a convex MPC controller trajectories for the reaction forces, position and orientation of Mini-Cheetah considering the Single Rigid Body Model

Suggestions are welcome.
